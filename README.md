# Project Description

This project is a web application that allows users to check their own IP address and get its geolocation using an API. Additionally, users can search for the geolocation of any other IP address.

*The search history feature, displaying previously saved queries and their results.

### Main Features:
- üåê **Geolocation of the current IP:** The web application retrieves the geolocation information of the IP from which the request is made using an API. This provides data such as approximate location, country, city, and more.
  
- üîç **Geolocation search by IP:** Users can enter any IP address to get its geolocation, offering the flexibility to check any IP of their choice.

- üíæ **Save searches:** All performed searches are stored in the local storage (localStorage). This ensures that the search history remains available even after closing or reloading the browser, and it will only be deleted if the user explicitly chooses to do so.

### Key Features:
- ‚ö° **Simple and quick user interface.**
- üíæ **Search persistence via local storage.**
- üåç **Immediate access to the geolocation of any IP in real-time.**

### Technologies Used:
